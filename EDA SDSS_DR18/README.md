## About the project

Exploratory analysis of the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 18**, a dataset containing spectroscopic and photometric data from 100,000 astronomical objects.

**Goal:** Identify spectral patterns that distinguish between galaxies, stars, and quasars using statistical analysis and data visualization.

---

## Key findings

| Object type | Population | UV outliers (%) | Interpretation |
|------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Galaxies** | 52,207 (52.2%) | 0.20% | Stable spectral signatures due to averaging effect |
| **Stars** | 37,192 (37.2%) | 7.47% | High variability from nuclear fusion processes |
| **Quasars** | 10,414 (10.4%) | 6.51% | Extreme energetic events from supermassive black holes |

**Main conclusion:** The UV signature (u-g color index) works as an excellent discriminator for classifying astronomical objects. Stars show 37× more outliers than galaxies.

## What I analyzed

### General data
- 100,000 astronomical objects across 3 classes
- 43 features including spectral magnitudes, coordinates, and redshift
- Zero missing values

### Main variables
- **Photometric filters:** u, g, r, i, z (ultraviolet to near-infrared)
- **Color indices:** u-g (UV signature), g-r, r-i
- **Redshift:** Cosmological distance indicator
- **Petrosian metrics:** Galaxy morphology parameters

### Statistical methods
- Correlation analysis between spectral bands
- Outlier detection using IQR method
- Distribution analysis by object class
- Comparative statistics across populations

## What I learned

- **Physics:** Deepened my understanding of spectroscopy, redshift, and cosmic object classification
- **Statistics:** Applied robust methods for outlier detection and correlation analysis on astronomical data
- **Communication:** Translated complex astrophysics concepts into clear insights
- **Python:** Advanced use of Pandas and Seaborn for large dataset analysis
- **Interdisciplinarity:** Combined physics knowledge with data science techniques

## Why this project stands out

- Combines physics knowledge with data science techniques
- 100K+ observations analyzed with robust statistical methods
- Interpretations grounded in the physics of the objects, not just charts
- Clear documentation accessible to non-astronomers
- Applies statistical rigor learned in master's program

## Dataset

Analysis based on the **SDSS DR18** dataset.

**Source:** [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss.org/dr18/)

**Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size. Download it directly from SDSS and place `SDSS_DR18.csv` in the project root.
